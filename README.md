# A django app which displays tasks from a database(sqlite here), allowing users to filter the tasks by status and sort by priority or due date. One can add new tasks by going into the admin site. One can test the functionalities by applying the command python manage.py test. One can run an emulated server by using the command python manage.py runserver and then access the website at http://127.0.0.1:8000 or localhost:8000. One can see the tasks by using the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/tasks/. The database has a single table with six fields(including the id). One can create the table in the database using the commands python manage.py makemigrations and python manage.py migrate. The task_list view in the views.py file renders the tasks with the aid of the template task_list.html.
